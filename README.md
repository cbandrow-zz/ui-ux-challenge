# UI / UX Challenge

### Fitness Tracker from Spencer and Devin

The attached screenshots and links refer to our received design to create a functioning static comp. In order to build the comp, my partner decided to divide in conquer. Chris built out the desktop site, ensuring the structure was sound and well factored, while the other Chris designed the mobile site and checked to make sure the whole site could be responsively changed depending on the window size.

### Our Own Fitness Tracker

The following screenshots, user info, and wireframes refer to our designed site to send off to Spencer and Devin.

Our target user of our application was a 78 year old man. Specifically, our user was the one and only Sir Sean Connery of James Bond fame. We felt the application to be built was intended to be a simple fitness tracker, that gave a user fitness data, a schedule of simple workouts to track, some suggestions to spice up their routine, and instructions to help the user keep their form perfect for simple workouts. We designed this app for Sir Connery, in order for him to stay healthy into his elder years, and stay connected to a slightly younger population.
